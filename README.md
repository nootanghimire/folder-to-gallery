folder-to-gallery
=================

Did this when i was just learning PHP (and JS) and needed to create a image gallery. I put every 
image in the 'gallery' folder, and wrote a php script to create a javascript script which iterates through the images on the folder.


Simple to Use, Just watch those php and y'all will understand! 



Those days used to bee too exciting! ;)
